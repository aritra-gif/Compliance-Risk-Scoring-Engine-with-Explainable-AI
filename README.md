# 🛡️ Compliance Risk Scoring Engine with Explainable AI

A machine learning-based system that simulates risk scoring for compliance use cases — using real-world-inspired data patterns and **stacked ensemble learning**. This project reflects how AI can support governance teams in detecting and explaining high-risk operational anomalies.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- ✅ Simulates structured compliance data (flags, escalations, delays)
- 🤖 Builds a **stacked ensemble model** to predict high-risk cases
- 🔍 Uses **SHAP** to explain predictions for audit transparency
- 📈 Evaluates performance using ROC AUC and classification metrics

## 🔧 Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Ensemble Learning | Combines Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression |
| 📊 Risk Scoring Output | Predicts high-risk escalation cases |
| 🧠 SHAP Explainability | Shows feature contributions for each prediction |
| ⚡ Lightweight | No heavy infra or proprietary data — fully reproducible |
